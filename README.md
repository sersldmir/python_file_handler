# python_file_handler
My Python project dedicated to handling csv, pickle and txt files. A simple working tool with the potential of future modifications
Current capabilities:
- working with csv files and perfoming some operations with them (add, divide, subtract, multiply, compare columns; concatenating, splitting and merging) 
- pickling and unpickling files
- working with text files
- creating data on the go
