# python_file_handler
Made on Linux Ubuntu 22.04
My Python project dedicated to handling csv, pickle and txt files. A simple working tool with the potential of future modifications
Current capabilities:
- working with csv files and perfoming some operations with them (add, divide, subtract, multiply, compare columns; concatenating, splitting and merging) 
- pickling and unpickling files
- working with text files
- creating data on the go

_Version 0.1_
- Added function creating data directly in the programm for further use
